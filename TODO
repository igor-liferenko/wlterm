after ./configure is run, save all generated files to git and do not use ./configure anymore

NOTE: use --debug option

understand when is called this code:
  llog_debug(vte, "unhandled control char %u", ctrl);
(this happens when I do cfmakeraw on controlling tty and press CTRL+C)

make that bold and underlined text will be handled in manpages, like it is in gnome-terminal

Change hack about KEY_bracketleft to use something other than KEY_ENTER (no matter if it begins with ^[[ or ^[O).
In general, grep vte_write in wlterm/ and any sequence in 'infocmp -1' that is not in the grep may be used.
And then change em/ repo because now it is using current hack about KEY_ENTER for CTRL+[.

see term/TODO

Reasons for replacing gnome-terminal:

1. https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/367994/how-to-make-c-generate-a-given-control-sequence (wlterm does it wrong by default, as gnome-terminal)
2. KP_Enter in less search mode (/) gives ESCOM instead of doing the search (wlterm does it wrong by default, as gnome-terminal)
3. pass F1-F12 keys to the application (wlterm does it right by default, unlike gnome-terminal)
4. be able to adjust width of terminal to exactly 100 slots in fullscreen mode (customizing font size alone does not give exactly 100-slot width of window on some monitors); see -DNOTEBOOK for an example how I did it in "term" repo

Purge code which does not concern full-screen mode (i.e., decorations, maximize stuff, etc)

for useful info see git log cdd87983a0b8e026917b167a601d594ded29427d.. in ~/kmscon/

After you do everything, remove term/, wterm/, libtsm/ and kmscon/ repos.
