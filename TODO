understand when is called this code:
  llog_debug(vte, "unhandled control char %u", ctrl);
(this happens when I do cfmakeraw on controlling tty and press CTRL+C)

make that bold and underlined text will be handled in manpages, like it is in gnome-terminal

Change hack about KEY_bracketleft to use something other than KEY_ENTER (no matter if it begins with ^[[ or ^[O).
In general, grep vte_write in wlterm/ and any sequence in 'infocmp -1' that is not in the grep may be used.
And then change em/ repo because now it is using current hack about KEY_ENTER for CTRL+[.
